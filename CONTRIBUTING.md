developed in a fluent and organized way, thanks.

2. If you can think about something you can add, correct or improve, feel free
  to do it.
3. Write clean code, adding comments if you find necesary.
4. Beware with the way you name variables and functions so they don't match 
  semantically with previous created ones.
